# Microcomputers_Lab4_Report

## Introduction 
This laboratory is a good example of the external interrupt routine usage in a practical situation. We have a water tank which detects water level from three switches, when the bottom switch is on, water is filled and it continues to fill even when middle switch turns on. But when the third switch turns on, the interrupt (RB0 external interrupt) runs, which removes water from tank for 500 ms or simply half a second. Our task was to create a PCB which a PIC16F877A microcontroller can mount on, and send signals to do the above operation.

## Results
The PCB circuit is working as intended. The code was made in such a way that, if the switches were to input anything other than the updated truth table values given, it will momenterally turn off all operations until the input matches with what is needed again. This is because, in a practical situation, this could be due to a malfunction, and operation during a malfunction is generally not a good idea. In addition this function and our task mentioned at the introduction, this implemented PCB circuit does them fine.

The other implemented modal is to represent the water tank, if this was an actual scenario. When this modal is running, you can see that when the representive water level reaches the top switch 3, the water level drops down just filled to switch 3 level again, and this continues on in an oscillatory fashion. The other circuit which runs the motors by using transistors instead of using a motor controller like the PCB design is used here, because the motors used are very low power.

So essentially, both implmetations yeilded good results, as the first PCB circuit with its implementation allowed us to test the code. While, the other modal showed how this would function in the practical situation. Also, creating two circuits with different methods to run the motors gave us good insight.

## Code Used for The Full Implementation
* This had to be changed from the uploaded Proteus tested code, because of the usage of IR sensors and Motor controller IC in the PCB circuit.
