# Microcomputers_Lab4_Report

## Introduction 
This laboratory is a good example of the external interrupt routine usage in a practical situation. We have a water tank which detects water level from three switches, when the bottom switch is on, water is filled and it continues to fill even when middle switch turns on. But when the third switch turns on, the interrupt (RB0 external interrupt) runs, which removes water from tank for 500 ms or simply half a second. Our task was to create a PCB which a PIC16F877A microcontroller can mount on, and do the above operation.

## Results
The circuit is working as intended. The code was made in such a way that, if the switches were to input anything other than the updated truth table values given, it will momenterally turn off all operations until the input matches with what is needed again. This is because, in a practical situation, this could be due to a malfunction, and operation during a malfunction is generally not a good idea. In addition this function and our task mentioned at the introduction, this implemented circuit does them fine.

## Code
// PIC16F877A Configuration Bit Settings

// 'C' source line config statements

// CONFIG
#pragma config FOSC = HS        // Oscillator Selection bits (HS oscillator)
#pragma config WDTE = OFF       // Watchdog Timer Enable bit (WDT disabled)
#pragma config PWRTE = OFF      // Power-up Timer Enable bit (PWRT disabled)
#pragma config BOREN = OFF      // Brown-out Reset Enable bit (BOR disabled)
#pragma config LVP = OFF        // Low-Voltage (Single-Supply) In-Circuit Serial Programming Enable bit (RB3 is digital I/O, HV on MCLR must be used for programming)
#pragma config CPD = OFF        // Data EEPROM Memory Code Protection bit (Data EEPROM code protection off)
#pragma config WRT = OFF        // Flash Program Memory Write Enable bits (Write protection off; all program memory may be written to by EECON control)
#pragma config CP = OFF         // Flash Program Memory Code Protection bit (Code protection off)

// #pragma config statements should precede project file includes.
// Use project enums instead of #define for ON and OFF.
